    <h2>Free Food Bank</h2>
	 
    <h3>For the UK & Ireland</h3>
    
	  <h4>What it does:</h4>
 
	     <p>I created this page to support Ireland and the UK in addressing Food Poverty. Free Foodbank App is going to address this problem by creating an app that has no gatekeeping. 

It will be free to use for everyone, regardless of your technological circumstances. All you will need is a valid Internet connection to access a directory of food banks across the UK and Ireland. 

What I need is your support to host the system that I'm using called AppSheets. This means that I can host all the data on my side so we don't run into any messy data issues. As we need to collect what is considered public data I need to take every precaution to make sure that the Foodbanks who want their data up on the app is contacted and consented. 

The process for the app happens as follow:

1): I reach out to a Foodbank through social media or email, explaining who I am and what FFB is about and if they'd like to join
2): I take down the publically available information - store it 
3): Await for a reply.
4): If I don't hear back the information is deleted Simple!

For the future, I intend to have a report & apply system where organisations can apply for their content to added or removed to the app. 

Hosting this publically will be at a cost noted on the Appsheets Website as $540 USD

All of the proceeds for this Patreon will go to paying for the app. </p>
